CONNECT = mongodb+srv://Gaurav:Gorkha2023@cluster0.ozek6aa.mongodb.net/DAB?retryWrites=true&w=majority

# Node.js: Install Node.js to run JavaScript on the server-side. You can download the installer from the Node.js official website and follow the installation instructions for your specific operating system.

# Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Choose a text editor or an IDE for writing your code. Some popular choices include Visual Studio Code, Atom, Sublime Text, or WebStorm.

# Package Manager: Node.js comes with npm (Node Package Manager) by default. It allows you to install and manage the necessary libraries and dependencies for your application.

# React.js: React.js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. You can install it using npm after setting up the Node.js environment. React.js typically does not require any specific installation
   beyond the npm package.

# Browser: You will need a web browser to test and run your web application. Popular choices include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Safari.

It's important to note that the MERN stack assumes a basic understanding of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, as these are fundamental to web development. Additionally, make sure to have a good 
understanding of the concepts and principles behind each component of the stack to effectively build your web application.
